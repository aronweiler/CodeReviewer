- Lines: 13-13: The `json` module is imported inside the `from_json_file` method. It is a good practice to keep all imports at the top of the file to make it clear what dependencies the module has.
- Lines: 15-16: There is no error handling for the file operations. If the file does not exist or is not accessible, the program will crash. Consider adding a try-except block to handle potential `IOError` or `FileNotFoundError`.
- Lines: 22-23: The environment variables are directly used without any validation. This can lead to unexpected behavior if they are not set or if they contain invalid values. Consider adding checks to validate these values.
- Lines: 31-32: The dictionary values are directly used without any validation. This can lead to unexpected behavior if they are not set or if they contain invalid values. Consider adding checks to validate these values.
- Lines: 34-34: The `LLMArguments.from_dict` method is called without checking if the 'llm' key exists in the dictionary. This could raise a `KeyError` if the key is not present. Consider using the `dict.get` method to provide a default value when the key is not present.
